# Color Clusterer

An *unsupervised* learning problem that involves clustering similar shades of 10 different base colors generated on the fly using Rubix [Generators](https://github.com/RubixML/RubixML#generators). The idea is to generate a training and testing set full of synthetic data that we'll later use to train and test a [Gaussian Mixture](https://github.com/RubixML/RubixML#gaussian-mixture) clusterer. In this tutorial, you'll learn the concepts of unsupervised clustering and synthetic data generation and visualization.
