# Color Clusterer

An *unsupervised* learning problem that involves clustering similar shades of 10 different base colors generated on the fly using Rubix [Generators](https://github.com/RubixML/RubixML#generators). The idea is to generate a training and testing set full of synthetic data that we'll later use to train and test a [Fuzzy C Means](https://github.com/RubixML/RubixML#fuzzy-c-means) clusterer. FCM is a Probabilistic estimator that uses *distance* as a way of distinguishing clusters of data points. In this tutorial, you'll learn the concepts of clustering and synthetic data generation.
